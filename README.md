Scraping USNews College Ranking data, Python

Utilizing Python Requests and BeautifulSoup package to parse USNews college ranking data. Save ranking to CSV file.

Since USNews college ranking data is partially publiced and can't download as a csv file for further exploration and analysis, I wrrote a simple Python script to do that for you. In my output csv file, there are four fields for 280 colleges: id 1:280, rank (could be tied), college name and location. You can certainly add more fields like score, tuition by modifying html tag name and class name.

Hope it could help.
